# LinkedOut

A one-person [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/). That being said, you will be able to build more interesting, multi-user features after you've built an MVP.

## Getting Started

You'll need SQLite3 to complete this project. If you haven't installed it already, read our [guide for installing SQLite3][sqlite3-install].

Once you have SQLite3 working, you can set up your development environment with the following steps:

1. Fork and clone this repository
- Install the dependent gems: `bundle install --without production`
- Create a `.env` file from the default `cp .env.example .env`
- Seed the database with `bundle exec rake db:seed`
- Run the server and restart when files change `bundle exec rerun -c rackup`
